# m64p Guide

❗ Follow the [Getting Started section](../README.md#getting-started) of `README.md` first.

This section of the guide explains how to setup [m64](https://m64p.github.io/), a Nintendo Switch emulator. The emulator is based on [mupen64plus-gui](https://github.com/m64p/mupen64plus-gui), which itself is a frontend for [mupen64plus](https://mupen64plus.org/).

-   Select `Nintendo 64 - Mupen64Plus` under Community Presets.
-   You can add additional categories to Steam category using the format `${category name}`, this is case-sensitive.
-   Set executable to `/usr/bin/flatpak`.
-   Set command line arguments to `run io.github.m64p.m64p "${filePath}"`
-   Set ROMs directory to wherever your N64 ROMs are - if you're using the recommended path, this should be `~/roms/n64`.
-   Press save.
